<!-- # Docker
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables us to separate our applications from our infrastructure so we can deliver software quickly. 
With Docker, we can manage your infrastructure in the same ways we manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and 
deploying code quickly, we can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

### VM:
Using virtual machine (VM) software, for example, Ubuntu can be installed inside a Windows. And they would both run at the same time. It is like building a PC, with its core components like CPU, RAM, Disks, Network Cards etc, within an operating system and assemble them to work as if it was a real PC. This way, the virtual PC becomes a "guest" inside an actual PC which with its operating system, which is called a host.

### Container:
It's same as above but instead of using an entire operating system, it cut down the "unnecessary" components of the virtual OS to create a minimal version of it. This lead to the creation of LXC (Linux Containers). It therefore should be faster and more efficient than VMs.

### Purpose of Docker:
Its primary focus is to automate the deployment of applications inside software containers and the automation of operating system level virtualization on Linux. It's more lightweight than standard Containers and boots up in seconds.

Similary, we can use other services, like **Pulling Docker Image**, **Writing Docker File** , and many more.
